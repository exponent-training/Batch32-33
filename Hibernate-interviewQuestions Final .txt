1)What is hibernate ?
-it is a framework which is used to connect oops lang application to rdbms
-ORM

2)Adv of hibernate over jdbc?
-works on object
-Automatic query generation
-Reducing boiler plate code
-Independent on db
-Exception handling

3)What is dialect,hbm2ddl,show_sql?
-Dialect-Which type of query to create datatypes change
-hbm2ddl-hbm to ddl automatically
-show_sql-just print query on console

4)what is Driver ?
-bridge between java app and db
-4 types of driver
-thin,jdbc-odbc,native,network protocol

5)Session-Factory
-Core interface on hibernate
-used to create connection between java app and db
-used create instance of session

6)What is session?
-it ia mediator between java app and db
-interface
-it provides multiple methods to perform oprtaions

7)how can we create instance of session?
-openSession() and getCurrentSession()
-openSession() always return new instance of session
-getCurrentSession() it checks if any session is open then taht session if not then new instance of session
-for getCurrentSession() we need to provide one property current_session_class

8)What is annnotations?
-provide additional info to jvm

9)@Entity
-present in javax.persitance
-class level annotation
-used to map java class to db table

10)@Table
-custom table name

11)@Id
-to declare primary key

12)@Column
-custom column name

13)@GeneratedValue
-to generate id automatically
-adding auto_increamet constraint

14)diff between statergy auto and indintity
-auto is for maintain sequence in multiple table
-indentity is for single table sequence maintain

15)Diff between save and persist
-to insert the object in db table
-save returns serlisable int (id)
-persist returns void

16)diff betwn save and saveOrUpdate
-save always create new row in table
-saveOrUpadte create new row if data not present if present then upadte

17)Diff betn get and load
-to fetch data by using id
-get returns actual data while load return proxy
-get returns null if id is not present but load methods thow ObjectNotFoundEXception
-get supports egar loading nad load support lazy loading
-if we are not sure id is presnt in db or not then we go fro get
- if we are sure then we go for load

18)What is dirty checking?
-Unwantted checking of columns while inserting or upating data by hibernate

19)how to avoid dirty checking
-by using annotations @DynamicInsert and @DynamicUpdate on entity class

20)What is mapping?
-providing relation between to calsses and acuaring same realtion in rdbms by using mapping annotations

21)@OneToOne
-one enity associated with another one entity
-One person has one adhar card

22)What is cascading
-if we perform some operation on target entity it gets reflected on child in cascading

23)type of cascading

24)@OneToMany
--one enity associated with another Many entity
-One company multiple employees

25)What happens if we don't provide no-args constructor in entity class?
-ibernate uses Instance class getConstructor() it requires no args construstor
-if we don't provide it will show InstanstiaionException

26)How hibernate handle the exception throws from jdbc steps?
-it convert the compile time exception into runtime exception
-SQLException --- HibernateException


27)Hbm2ddl_auto "update","create" diff 
-Hbm2ddl_auto is used to perform ddl operation auyomatically
-create - always create new table drop if exists
-update - update table if exist oyherwise create new

28)What is caching?
-it is an mechanism of pooling of an object
-aplliaction performance will increase

29)Diff between 1st level and  second level cache?
-1st - at session level,on by default,clear() / evict()
-2nd - at Sessionfactory,vendors EhCache,evict() and evictAll()


30)diff between clear and evict method
-clear -- to remove all cache from session
-evict -- to remove particular obj cache from session

31)how to clear second level cache
-first getCahche() from sf
-Cache has methods like evict() and evictAll()


32)annotation for cache and concurrency stagies
-@Cache
-READ_ONLY
-READ_WRITE
-TRANSTIONAL

33)vendors for 2nd cache
-EhCache
-JBoss

34)What is HQL
-Hibernate Query Lang
-Independent on db
-extension of SQL
-Works on class and variables

35)Why we use HQL
-to perform complex query or custom query that we can't use with session method

36)diff HQL and SQL
-Hql is extension of SQL
-HQL works on class/oops lanf where SQL works on table/db
-HQL supported by ever db through hibernate but SQL supported only in MySQL
-HQL is faster than SQL

37)Why we use NamedQuery
-Beacuse of HQL code becomes unreadableor complixity increases
-to avoid that we declear query on entity class using this annotation
-providing a simple name to query and calling will increase code readiablity and performce

38)Why we use NamedNativeQuery
-Beacuse of HQL code becomes unreadableor complixity increases
-to avoid that we declear query on entity class using this annotation
-providing a simple name to query and calling will increase code readiablity and performce
-in case this native is query is supported 
-native means speacific db type

39)what is use of Criteria Api
-beacause of writing query it makes tha program dependent on query lang
-we need to use or create custom or complex query by using some methods
-so for that hibernate provided Criteria API
-using this we can custom qurey with help of builder methods

40)N+1 problem
-it nothing but performancr issue in hibernate 
where if we tried get all details from one table related to another table with @OneToMany or @ManyToMany relation in that case it fires 1 query for first and N query for child table
-so it makes N+1 query for sinle operation
-it makes app slower
-to avoid it ""

41)Egar and lazy Loading
-Egar - fetching associcated deatils withod calling it
-Lazy - faecthing deatils whenever required

-OneToOne  -Egar
-OneToMany -Lazy
-ManyToOne -Egar
-ManyToMany-Lazy

42)States of obj in Hibernate
-Trasient- when we create an obj which is independent on db or not present in db
-Persistent-an obj which present in db or session and java app
-detached - an obj not present in session but present in db and present in java app

Trasient --- save,upadte,saveOrUpdate,persist -- Persistent --- clear,evict,evictAll,close,detach -- detached

detached --- merge,save,upadte,saveOrUpdate,persist --- persitent --- delete -- tarsient

43)Can we make entity class final
-no we can't
-hibernate inheritate the entity to to get its properties
-so we can't make entity class final

44)What is pegination
-restricting data fetching
-using fetchSize()
-setMaxResult()

45)SingleTable Stargey
-in case of inheritance the parent and child data stored in single table using @Discriminator column brtn them

46)TablePerClass stargey
-in case of inheritance the parent and child data stored in table per class

47)SQL injection attack
-when we use hibernate predefined methods there is a chance of data breaching
-that is called SQL injection attack
-we can go criteriaor we can go for validition
